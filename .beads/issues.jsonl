{"id":"hemisphere-49o","title":"Hemisphere Learning App - Master Epic","description":"A learning application grounded in Iain McGilchrist's 'The Master and His Emissary'. Core thesis: the right hemisphere (The Master) provides broad, contextual, relational attention while the left hemisphere (The Emissary) provides narrow, focused, analytical attention. Modern education is heavily left-hemisphere biased. This app rebalances learning by: (1) RIGHT first - present the whole, use metaphor, narrative, embodied context, emotional engagement; (2) LEFT - analyze, categorize, abstract, practice, drill; (3) RIGHT again - return to the whole, integrate, see connections, apply in new contexts. The app uses neuroscience-informed pedagogy to improve learning outcomes through hemisphere-aware instructional design.","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-10T19:10:20.833956Z","created_by":"shanemurtagh","updated_at":"2026-02-10T19:10:20.833956Z"}
