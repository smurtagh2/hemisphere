              Close your eyes for a moment.

              Four chords. That's all it takes.

              Thousands of songs — from Baroque cantatas to stadium anthems — are built from the same four-chord sequence. You've heard it in pop, in film scores, in hymns. You felt it without knowing its name.

              Today you'll learn its name. And why it moves you.

              ## The Composer's Secret

              In 1714, Antonio Vivaldi sat down to write a concerto. He needed music that would evoke spring — birdsong, warming air, the return of life. He reached for the same harmonic tools composers had been using for a century: a home chord, a tension chord, a detour into sadness, and a return home.

              Three hundred years later, those same four moves appeared in "Let It Be," "No Woman No Cry," "Africa," "Don't Stop Believin'," and over a thousand other songs. Axis of Awesome performed 36 of them in a single medley, switching seamlessly from one to the next, revealing the skeleton beneath the skin.

              Why do these same four chords appear across cultures, centuries, and genres?

              Because they map onto something universal: the human experience of departure and return. We leave home. We feel tension. We find a moment of sadness or reflection. We come back. That is the shape of a story. And harmony is how music tells it.

              # Chord Progressions

              A chord progression is a sequence of chords played in a specific order.

              Chords don't exist in isolation — they gain meaning through motion. Moving from one chord to another creates expectation, tension, and resolution: the building blocks of musical narrative.

              The I–V–vi–IV Progression

              The most common progression in Western popular music uses four chords built on scale degrees I, V, vi, and IV.

              Scale Degree I — C major — notes C–E–G — character: Home, stable.
              Scale Degree V — G major — notes G–B–D — character: Tension, forward.
              Scale Degree vi — A minor — notes A–C–E — character: Reflective, ache.
              Scale Degree IV — F major — notes F–A–C — character: Open, expansive.

              The sequence moves away from home (I), builds tension (V), explores sadness (vi), and opens outward (IV) — before cycling back. It is departure and return compressed into four chords.

              Why it works across genres: The progression balances stability and movement. The V chord wants to resolve back to I (a pull called dominant resolution). The vi chord introduces a minor colour without full dissonance. The IV chord provides breathing room before the return.

              # Tension and Release: Consonance and Dissonance

              Consonance — intervals and chords that sound stable, at rest.
              Dissonance — intervals and chords that sound tense, wanting to move.

              In a chord progression, consonance and dissonance alternate to create momentum. Music without dissonance has no tension — nothing to resolve. Music without consonance has no home — nowhere to return.

              Dominant Resolution: The Strongest Pull in Tonal Music

              The move from V to I is the most powerful harmonic gesture in Western music. The V chord (dominant) contains a tritone — the most dissonant interval — between its third and seventh (in a V7 chord). This tritone must resolve:

              The seventh of the dominant falls by a semitone to the third of the tonic (B to C in C major). The tritone disappears into consonance.

              This resolution is called dominant-to-tonic or V to I. You hear it at the end of almost every traditional song, phrase, and cadence. It is the harmonic equivalent of a held breath finally released.

              The vi Chord: Relative Minor

              The vi chord shares two notes with I — in C major, Am (A–C–E) shares C and E with C major (C–E–G). This makes the move from I to vi feel like a subtle darkening, a shadow falling over the same landscape. Not a departure to somewhere foreign — a shift in light.

              # Chord Types: The Vocabulary of Harmony

              A chord is three or more notes sounding together. The intervals between those notes give each chord its emotional character.

              Major Chord — Root plus Major 3rd (4 semitones) plus Minor 3rd (3 semitones). Sounds bright, stable, complete. Example: C major = C–E–G.

              Minor Chord — Root plus Minor 3rd (3 semitones) plus Major 3rd (4 semitones). Sounds darker, more inward, reflective. Example: A minor = A–C–E.

              Dominant Seventh Chord — Major chord plus Minor 7th (10 semitones from root). Sounds tense, urgent, pointing forward. Example: G dominant seventh = G–B–D–F. Note: The F creates a tritone with B, generating the pull toward resolution.

              Why the vi is minor matters:
              In the I–V–vi–IV progression, the vi chord is always minor. This is not a coincidence — it is the contrast that gives the progression its emotional depth. The I and IV are bright; the V is tense; the vi is the moment of shadow that makes the return to I feel like relief.

              Chord type formulas in semitones from root:
              Major — 0 plus 4 plus 3 — sounds bright.
              Minor — 0 plus 3 plus 4 — sounds dark.
              Dominant Seventh — 0 plus 4 plus 3 plus 3 — sounds tense.

              The I–V–vi–IV progression appears in songs by Bach, the Beatles, and Beyonce. These composers lived in completely different worlds, with different instruments, audiences, and intentions.

              Why does the same four-chord sequence keep reappearing?

              Consider: what makes V to I feel like resolution? What does the minor vi add that I and IV cannot provide alone? Is this cultural learning, or something more fundamental?

                modelAnswer: |
                  The I–V–vi–IV progression creates a complete emotional arc within a short cycle. The V chord creates tension through dominant resolution (a fundamental feature of tonal harmony based on the physics of the overtone series, not cultural convention). The vi chord introduces emotional depth — sadness or reflection — without abandoning the harmonic home. The IV broadens the sound without creating urgency. The return to I provides relief. Together, the four chords enact a compressed narrative: security, tension, feeling, resolution. This mirrors a pattern found in storytelling across cultures. The progression may persist because it maps onto something universal in human emotional experience, not merely because of musical convention.
                feedback:
                  general: "Compare your thinking to this explanation. Did you arrive at the same core idea — that the progression mirrors a universal emotional arc?"

              You now understand something that most people who love music have never articulated: why those four chords work.

              The V chord creates urgency through a tritone that wants to resolve. The vi chord darkens the palette by sharing notes with home but lowering the third. The IV chord opens space before the return. The I chord is relief, arrival, home.

              This is not theory. This is the structure of felt experience — the reason a chord change can make you gasp, or weep, or feel the world expand.

              Go back to the song you thought of at the beginning. Listen to it now. You are the same person — but you are hearing with different ears.

                  In film scoring, composers often use a technique called Mickey Mousing — matching the music precisely to on-screen action. But the most emotionally powerful film scores often do the opposite: they play a gentle, consonant theme against horrifying imagery, or a tense, dissonant progression against a quiet scene.

                  Based on what you've learned about consonance, dissonance, and the emotional function of chord progressions, why might contrast between music and image be more emotionally powerful than alignment?
                modelAnswer: |
                  When music aligns exactly with the emotion of an image, it confirms the viewer's expectation — there is no gap for the viewer to fill in. When music contrasts with the image, the viewer's brain must hold two conflicting emotional signals simultaneously. This gap creates a kind of cognitive tension that intensifies the emotional response — much like how a tense harmonic progression intensifies the listener's desire for resolution. The dissonance between what is seen and what is heard can be more disturbing than either alone, because the viewer's emotional processing must work harder. The harmonic principle of tension-and-release maps onto the cinematic principle of contrast-and-convergence.
                feedback:
                  general: "The principle of tension-and-release that drives harmony also drives narrative, visual composition, and emotional contrast across art forms."

            feedback:
              correct: "Correct — dominant resolution (V to I) is the strongest harmonic gesture in tonal music. The tritone in the V chord resolves into the consonance of I."
              incorrect: "The strongest pull in the progression is V to I — dominant resolution. The tritone within the V chord (or V7) demands resolution into the stability of I."

              A week from now, listen actively to a song you encounter in your daily life. Try to identify whether it uses the I–V–vi–IV progression (or a variant). Notice where the tension builds and where it releases. Write a brief note on what you observe.
