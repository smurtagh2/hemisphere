            content: |
              It's the morning after a hurricane hits Florida.

              You drive to the hardware store. The plywood is gone. So is the bottled water. The generator that costs $500 on a normal day has a handwritten price tag: $1,200.

              You feel it in your stomach—outrage, maybe. That's price gouging.

              Or is it?

            title: Two Forces Running the World
            content: |
              ## The Most Powerful Invisible Force You've Never Seen

              Every morning, millions of farmers in a dozen countries decide how much coffee to grow. Every morning, billions of people decide whether to brew a cup. Nobody coordinates these decisions. No government office sets the price. No single company is in charge.

              And yet—every morning, the right amount of coffee appears at roughly the right price in stores around the world.

              Adam Smith called this the "invisible hand" in 1776. He meant that individuals pursuing their own interests—farmers trying to earn more, consumers trying to pay less—are guided as if by an invisible hand to produce outcomes that benefit everyone.

              The mechanism behind the invisible hand has two moving parts: **supply** and **demand**. Together they answer the most fundamental question in all of economics:

              *Who gets what, at what price?*

              Understanding this mechanism won't just help you in economics class. It will change how you read the news, why you see certain products disappear from shelves, why rents rise in some neighborhoods and fall in others, and yes—why that post-hurricane generator costs $1,200.

              # The Law of Demand

              **Demand** is the relationship between price and how much of something buyers want to purchase.

              The **Law of Demand** states: as price rises, quantity demanded falls; as price falls, quantity demanded rises. *All else equal.*

              Why? Two reasons:
              1. **Substitution effect** — when coffee gets expensive, some people switch to tea.
              2. **Income effect** — a higher price leaves you with less real purchasing power, so you buy less of everything.

              On a graph, the demand curve slopes **downward** from left to right.

              | Price (per unit) | Quantity Demanded |
              |------------------|-------------------|
              | $1               | 500 units/day     |
              | $2               | 350 units/day     |

            content: |
              # The Law of Supply

              **Supply** is the relationship between price and how much of something producers are willing and able to sell.

              The **Law of Supply** states: as price rises, quantity supplied increases; as price falls, quantity supplied decreases. *All else equal.*

              Why? Higher prices make production more profitable, so existing producers sell more and new producers enter the market.

              On a graph, the supply curve slopes **upward** from left to right.

              | Price (per unit) | Quantity Supplied |
              |------------------|-------------------|
              | $1               | 80 units/day      |
              | $2               | 200 units/day     |
              | $3               | 350 units/day     |

            title: Market Equilibrium
            content: |
              # Where Supply Meets Demand

              **Equilibrium** is the price at which quantity supplied exactly equals quantity demanded. The market "clears"—nothing is left over and nobody is turned away empty-handed.

              - If price is **above** equilibrium: quantity supplied > quantity demanded → **surplus** → prices fall.
              - If price is **below** equilibrium: quantity demanded > quantity supplied → **shortage** → prices rise.

              Markets are self-correcting. Surpluses push prices down; shortages push prices up. The market gravitates toward equilibrium like a pendulum finding its rest point.

              The generator after the hurricane is **not** at equilibrium until the price rises high enough that supply equals demand.

                expectedAnswer: |
                  When price rises, quantity demanded falls (and when price falls, quantity demanded rises), all else equal. This is because of the substitution effect (buyers switch to cheaper alternatives) and the income effect (higher prices reduce real purchasing power).

                question: A coffee shop raises the price of lattes from $4 to $6. According to the Law of Demand, what should happen to the quantity of lattes sold per day?
                context: Supply and Demand — Law of Demand
                options:
                  - id: opt-a
                    label: Quantity sold will increase because higher prices signal higher quality.
                    correct: false
                    rationale: This confuses signaling effects (a separate concept) with the basic demand relationship. At higher prices, most consumers will buy fewer lattes, not more.
                  - id: opt-b
                    label: Quantity sold will decrease because some buyers will substitute cheaper alternatives or simply buy fewer lattes.
                    correct: true
                    rationale: Correct. The substitution effect (switching to drip coffee or tea) and the income effect (lattes now take a bigger share of your budget) both reduce quantity demanded.
                  - id: opt-c
                    label: Quantity sold will stay the same because regular customers are loyal.
                    correct: false
                    rationale: Customer loyalty can soften the demand response, but it does not override it. Even loyal customers reduce purchases at significantly higher prices. This describes inelastic demand, not zero elasticity.
                  - id: opt-d
                    label: Quantity sold will increase because the shop will earn more revenue and expand.
                    correct: false
                    rationale: This confuses what happens on the supply side (the shop earns more per unit) with what happens on the demand side (customers buy fewer units). Revenue may go up or down depending on elasticity, but quantity demanded falls.
                explanation: The Law of Demand is straightforward here. A higher price means each unit costs more relative to alternatives. Some buyers will defect to cheaper substitutes; others will simply buy less. Quantity demanded falls.

                question: A drought destroys 30% of Brazil's coffee crop. Holding demand constant, what happens to the equilibrium price and quantity of coffee?
                context: Supply and Demand — Supply Shifts
                options:
                  - id: opt-a

                    correct: true
                    rationale: Correct. The supply curve shifts left (less coffee at every price). At the old equilibrium price, there is now a shortage. Price is bid up until a new equilibrium is reached—at a higher price and lower quantity.
                  - id: opt-b
                    label: Price falls, quantity rises.
                    correct: false
                    rationale: This would be the result of a supply increase (right shift). A drought reduces supply—the opposite direction.
                  - id: opt-c
                    label: Price rises, quantity rises.
                    correct: false
                    rationale: When supply falls, the price rises (correct) but the quantity at the new equilibrium is lower, not higher. Moving up the demand curve means buyers purchase less at the higher price.
                  - id: opt-d
                    label: Price and quantity both stay the same; the market self-corrects immediately.
                    correct: false
                    rationale: Markets do self-correct, but to a new equilibrium—not the old one. The supply shock permanently reduces available coffee until new supply comes online.
                explanation: A supply decrease (left shift of the supply curve) creates a shortage at the original price. The market clears at a higher price and lower quantity. This is exactly what happens to coffee prices after major crop failures in Brazil.

            title: The Invisible Hand, Revealed
            content: |
              Let's return to that $1,200 generator.

              Before the hurricane, supply and demand are roughly in balance. The equilibrium price is $500. Then the hurricane hits—and in a single hour, demand for generators surges (everyone needs one) while supply is temporarily fixed (the trucks can't get through). At the old price of $500, there is a massive shortage.

              The price gouger raises the price to $1,200. This does two things simultaneously:

              1. **It rations the existing supply.** At $1,200, only the buyers who need a generator most urgently—a hospital's backup power, a family with someone on a ventilator—can justify the price. The rest wait.

              2. **It signals opportunity to suppliers.** A generator company in Atlanta sees the price and sends a truck convoy overnight, taking the risk of the journey. By morning, supply has increased. The price starts to fall.

              The "price gouger" acted in pure self-interest. And yet, by doing so, he coordinated the emergency allocation of a scarce resource more effectively than any government office could have managed overnight.

              This is what Adam Smith saw. This is the invisible hand.

              Whether you find this beautiful or troubling is a different question—one that requires moving beyond the model into ethics and values. But the mechanism itself is real, and it is always running, silently, in every price you encounter.

                  Consider the market for **human kidneys for transplant**. There is a chronic shortage in most countries—thousands of patients die each year waiting for a kidney that never comes.

                  The economist's solution: allow people to be paid to donate a kidney. Critics say this is immoral—it exploits the poor.

                  Using what you learned about supply, demand, and equilibrium, explain: (a) why there is a shortage, and (b) what the economic argument for a legal market would be. You do not need to take a side—just apply the model.
                modelAnswer: |
                  (a) There is a shortage because the price of kidneys is effectively zero (donations are unpaid in most countries). At a price of zero, quantity demanded (patients who need a kidney) far exceeds quantity supplied (people willing to donate). This is a textbook shortage: price is below equilibrium.

                  (b) If a legal market were allowed, a positive price would shift the supply curve rightward (more people would be willing to supply a kidney at a price) and the market would reach a new equilibrium where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded—eliminating the shortage. This is the standard economic argument: allowing prices to function would save lives by clearing the market.

                  The counterarguments involve equity (poor people may feel coerced to sell) and human dignity (should some things be outside the market?). These are valid but they are normative (value) arguments, not positive (descriptive) economics.
                feedback:
                  general: You just applied a basic microeconomic model to one of the most contested policy debates in bioethics. The model doesn't settle the debate—but it clarifies what the debate is actually about.

            explanation: |
              Both shifts occurred simultaneously. Demand shifted right because buyers who couldn't get new cars turned to the used market. Supply shifted left because rental companies (a major source of used cars) held onto their fleets during the pandemic. Both shifts push price upward, which is what we observed.
