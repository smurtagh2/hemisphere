            title: The Bird That Changed Everything
            content: |
              In 1835, Darwin noticed that finches on neighboring islands had different beaks.

              The differences were small. The implications were not.

              If one ancestral bird could become many forms, species might not be fixed at all.

            content: |
              Darwin returned to England with specimens and a troubling hypothesis.

              If variation is inherited, and environments reward some traits over others, populations can change without a designer or plan.

              He delayed publication for years because he knew this idea would challenge assumptions about life, purpose, and humanity.

              Natural selection starts with **differences among individuals**.

              Those differences matter only when they are heritable. A scar is not inherited; a genetically influenced beak shape is.

                feedback:
                  correct: Correct. Selection needs variation, inheritance, and uneven reproductive success.
                  incorrect: "Look for three pieces: heritable variation, pressure from environment, and unequal reproduction."

                  correct: Correct. Selection acts on existing variation and changes population composition.

                modelAnswer: |
                  Bacterial populations include random heritable variation. Antibiotics create strong selection pressure by killing susceptible cells. Resistant variants survive and reproduce rapidly. Repeated antibiotic use repeats this filter, increasing resistant frequency each cycle.
                feedback:
                  general: Strong responses explicitly name variation, pressure, differential reproduction, and multi-generation frequency shifts.
