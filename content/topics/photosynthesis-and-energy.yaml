              Plants and algae capture photons and use them to build sugar from carbon dioxide and water.

              The sugar stores chemical energy. The oxygen becomes breathable atmosphere for many organisms, including us.

                  - sunlight

                  correct: Correct. Glucose stores energy originally captured from light; oxygen is released.
                  incorrect: "Include both products and the energy source: glucose, oxygen, and sunlight."

                modelAnswer: |
                  Reduced sunlight lowers light-reaction throughput, reducing ATP/NADPH production and carbon fixation. Plants synthesize less glucose, so biomass production declines. Herbivores face lower food availability first, followed by predator declines through the food web.
                feedback:
                  general: Strong answers link sunlight limits to energy capture, then trace second-order ecosystem effects.
